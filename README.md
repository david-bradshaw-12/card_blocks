### Implementation note
- Your interactive block implementation should live in the [`/client`](/client) directory, an app skeleton has been provided in the directory
- The beginnings of a REST API lives in [`/server`](/server/src/) and is reachable at http://localhost:5001

### Getting started


#### Install Docker

Install [Docker Community Edition](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=edition&offering=community)

- :apple: [macOS](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
- :penguin: [Linux](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community&operating_system=linux)
- ðŸªŸ [Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)

#### To get the Client up and running on your dev machine:

1. `cd client`
1. `nvm install`
1. `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
1. `yarn start` (or `npm start`)
1. If `yarn start` is throwing errors, you may need to run: `npm_config_yes=true npx yarn-audit-fix`

The client will be available at port 3000

#### To get the REST API up and running on your dev machine:

1. `cd server`
1. `docker-compose up`

The server will be available at port 5001 and the database will be available at port 7482

### Rebuilding Docker Containers

If you install any new packages or add a new database migration file you'll want to rebuild the docker containers. To do so:

1. Stop your docker containers with `CMD + C` or `CTRL + C`
1. `docker-compose down`
1. `docker-compose up --build`
